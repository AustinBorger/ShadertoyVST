## Overview

ShadertoyVST is an adaptation of the [Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/)
development environment in the form of a VST plugin. Its purpose is for creating
music visualizations, and therefore implements features that are more suited to
those ends. Automatable parameters and midi events are forwarded to the shaders
as uniforms, facilitating the use of a DAW to produce rhytmically synchronized
events that guide the animation.

## Contribution

All contributors are welcome. If you have a feature you would like to add to
ShadertoyVST, fork off a new repo and submit a pull request.
